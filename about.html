						<h4>Background</h4>
						<p>Greetings! First of all, thank you for visiting my website, and for taking the time to get to know a little about me and my work. My background is of a humble one. I come from a small town in the foothills of California. I was always a builder growing up- whether it be legos, helping my family with home construction projects, creating custom battle scenarios in Starcraft, or any and all art projects, I was always interested in seeing my creations come to life. It was not until recently that I started "going pro," by taking on a house flip, and building a website for my water company.</p>
						<p>The water website, <a href="http://www.thvmwc.com" target="_blank">www.thvmwc.com</a> was my fist major success with web development. The feeling I got from discovering front-end development was indescribable. It was more of a revelation that there was a world with unlimited resources, where creativity and imagination are the only constraints to building complex tools that actually could have a profound impact. It became apparent that a career working with the web was a way to make a measurable difference in the world. Needless to say, I was hooked. Now that I have the spark, I am moving forward with my career into web development to see just how big this new world is!</p>

						<h4>OK, What's the QuantumBit Thing About?</h4>
						<p>So, besides the fact that atomic physics is an incredibly fascinating field of science, and quantum computing is just around the corner, what interests me greatly about the subject is how mysterious sub-atomic mechanisms are. Quantum physics is still emerging each passing day, and the more we find out, the more obscure it seems to become. Despite it's perceived intangibility though, it is worth remembering that these tiny particles comprise literally all matter around us. Being from the mountains, I see a lot of value in the natural world, and have grown up with an understanding of our place in nature. When I was thinking of a theme for the portfolio, I wanted something that reflected this personality- a blending of the streamlined, manufactured look of tech, with the vast, breathtaking design of our own natural world.</p>
						<p>If you have a comment on how this theme can be improved upon, and rest assured, it will be, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
