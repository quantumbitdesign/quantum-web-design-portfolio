There is nothing to install with this. This website will work in most if not all web browsers such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Safari- especially those that have been properly updated. It is being designed with accessibility in mind, will be built using a mobile first approach, and will be optimized on the front end for speed using minification, custom picture sizing, and other techniques.

This piece of software does not require any tests. It passed them all. I saw.
